This program translates inputted text lyrics into modern art “Kandinski-style” graphics that will be displayed on the turtle canvas in a new window.

At the start of the program, users will copy and paste lyrics for a song of their choice into the blue text box. Once the submit button is pressed, the submitted text will be analyzed and a new window with a white canvas will appear. This window will show the art graphics that are associated with the different words in the lyrics; for instance, every time the word ‘love’ appears in the song, the canvas will draw a colorful spiral. Moreover, each time a word repeats, the value for its position or size updates. Thus, the appearance of the final graphic will be unique to the song since different graphics are assigned for different words and frequence of the words also effect the pattern. “By Clare Lee and Yuna Hahn” will appear at the top right hand corner of the window when the program is completed. This program integrates text analysis, turtle graphics, GUI, and art appreciation to design a simple mechanism for users to create their own version of modern art.
